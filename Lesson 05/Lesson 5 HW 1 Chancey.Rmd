#### 3.11 parts a and b  

Set Up
```{r}
raceparty <- matrix(c(192,75,8,459,586,471), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2)
dimnames(raceparty) <- list(race=c("Black", "White"), 
                            party=c("Democrat", "Independent", "Republican"))
raceparty
```

G Test
```{r}
library("DescTools")
rpg <- GTest(raceparty)
rpg
```
The \(G^2\) value of this contingency table is very high. This provides evidence to reject the null hypothesis, \(H_0: \pi_{ij} = \pi_{i+} \pi_{+j} \). The p-value indicates that this method will rarely reject the \(H_0\) when its true.  


Standardized Residuals
```{r}
rppf<- procfreq(raceparty)
rppf$adjusted.residuals
```


### Additional Problem 1  
Investigators studied the relationship between stage of breast cancer at diagnosis (local or advance) and a womanâ€™s living arrangement.  Of 144 women living alone, 41.0% had an advanced case; of 209 living with a spouse, 52.2% were advanced; and of 89 living with others, 59.6% were advanced.  The investigators reported their P-value for the relationship as 0.02 (Moritz and Satariano, J. Clin. Epidemiol. 45:443-454, 1993).  Reconstruct the analysis performed to obtain this P-value.

Set Up
```{r}
cancer <- matrix(c(
            round(144*.41),
            round(209*.522),
            round(89*.596),
            round(144*.59),
            round(209*.478),
            round(89*.404)),
            byrow = TRUE, 
            nrow = 2)
dimnames(cancer) <- list(stage=c("Advanced", "Local"), 
                        living=c("Alone", "Spouse", "Others"))
cancer <- t(cancer)
cancer
```

Method One
```{r}
library(MASS)
chisq.test(cancer)
```

Method Two
```{r}
cancerpf <- procfreq(cancer)
cancerpf$chi.square
```

I assume that researchers round up, given that I obtain a p value of 0.015.  

### Additional Problem 2  
Table 3.13 (p 106) presents a contingency table for a sample of patients by their diagnosis and whether they were prescribed medication.  Obtain standardized Pearson residuals for the independence model.  Interpret these results.

Set Up
```{r}
drug <- matrix(c(105,8,12,2,18,19,47,52,0,13), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 5)
dimnames(drug) <- list(diagnosis=c("Schizophrenia", "Affective", "Neurosis", "Personality", "Special"), 
                            drug=c("Yes", "No"))
drug
```


```{r}
chisq.test(drug, correct = TRUE)
```
The \(X^2\) value is 84.188 with a very small p value, well below 0.05. This result provides evidence to reject the null hypothesis - \(H_0: \pi_{ij} = \pi_{i+} \pi_{+j} \). The p-value indicates that this method will rarely reject the \(H_0\) when its true.
